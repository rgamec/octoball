## Introduction
Simple implementation of the classic eight-ball toy as a script for the irssi IRC client.

## Usage
1. Install by putting octoball.pl script into ~/.irssi/scripts, then either use "/script load octoball.pl" inside irssi or else make a symlink in ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ to have the script load automatically whenever irssi starts.
2. When someone in a channel sends the command "!octoball <question>", the script will offer up a random response.

## Todo
* Improve debugging and script information.
* Offer alternative eight-ball responses.
* Implement a weighted response system.
